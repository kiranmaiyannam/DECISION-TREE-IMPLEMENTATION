INTERN ID : CT2MTDM665

DOMAIN : Machine Learning

DURATION : 8 WEEKS

MENTOR : NEELA SANTOSH

# DESCRIPTION

This project demonstrates the implementation and visualization of a Decision Tree Classifier using the Scikit-learn library in Python. The objective is to train a machine learning model that can classify or predict outcomes based on input features. This project forms a part of the internship task assigned by CodTech.

The decision tree model is built on a well-known dataset, such as the Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers and whether they survived or not. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and graphical visualization of the decision tree structure.

# Key Features
Load and preprocess structured data
Train a Decision Tree Classifier
Visualize the decision tree structure
Evaluate the model using accuracy and classification metrics
Plot confusion matrix for detailed performance insights

# Technologies Used
Python
Scikit-learn
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn

Data Loading

Loaded a classification dataset using pandas or built-in scikit-learn loaders.
Data Preprocessing

Cleaned data, encoded categorical features, and handled missing values if needed.

Train-Test Split
Divided the data into training and testing sets using train_test_split().
